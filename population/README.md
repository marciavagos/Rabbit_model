Use the `population.sh` script too run the model in batch. 

    bash population.sh

To simulate only the 16 control models, use either the `params_CTL.txt` file with `indices` 1 - 17 (option 1), or
the `params_pop.txt` file with the corresponding `indices` in the bash file (option 2). 
These are the same.
 
To run the entire population of 3000 models, use the `params_pop.txt` file with the `indices` 1 - 3000 (option 3)
